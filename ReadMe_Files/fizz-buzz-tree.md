# Challenge - FizzBuzz Tree

## Overview
- In this module, we are writing a function "fizz_buzz_tree" that takes a binary tree of integers as an arguement and does "FizzBuzz" to the values in the binary tree.

- Looking at every value in the binary tree, our function will determine that, if a value is evenly divisible by 3 its value will be reassigned to "Fizz". If the value is evenly divisible by 5 then its value will be reassigned to "Buzz". If the value is both evenly divisible by 3 and by 5, then its value will be reassigned to "FizzBuzz". If none of these conditions are met, then our function will reassign the integer to a string of the same value.

## visual :

* Starting Values => [2] -> [3] -> [5] -> [10] -> [15] -> [19]
* After fizz_buzz_tree:
- Returns => ['2'] -> ['Fizz'] -> ['Buzz'] -> ['Buzz'] -> ['FizzBuzz'] -> ['19']
