# Implementation: Singly Linked Lists
- Create an algorithm that Implement and create a linked list and 
___


## Approach & Efficiency
- in this chal i use append to append the node in the end and the worst case for this fuction is O(n) .
- also i use insert_after function to add a node after a specific index
- and  method insert_before to add a node before  a specific index worst case for this fuction is O(n)
